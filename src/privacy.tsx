      This website does not use cookies and does not collect any kind of information about its
      visitors. All information entered on this website, for example a mood or a note (hereafter
      called "Diary Content"), are stored in the integrated storage of the visitors browser, unless
      the visitor chooses to connect a cloud storage (see "Cloud Storage").

    <h4>Information Collected by the Hoster</h4>
    <p>
      This website is hosted using a service of GitLab B.V. ("GitLab"). Like most hosters, GitLab
      collects basic non-personally-identifying information from website visitors of the sort that
      web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
      preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.<br />
      <br />
      GitLab also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol
      (IP) addresses from visitors. GitLab does not use such information to identify or track
      individual visitors, however.<br />
      <br />

    <h4>Cloud Storage</h4>
    <p>
      In case the visitor chooses to connect a cloud storage, all Diary Content will be saved on
      the servers of said cloud storage, and the Privacy Policy of the respective provider applies:
